    <p>
      I'm a self-taught frontend developer with over a year of hands-on
      experience building responsive web apps using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I
      enjoy learning by doing — solving algorithmic problems and building
      real-world projects to deepen my understanding. Along the way, I’ve also
      worked with modern tools like React, Tailwind CSS, and Material UI (MUI)
      to create dynamic, user-friendly interfaces.

      This portfolio was built without frameworks to sharpen my core
      understanding of the web. I focused on clean structure, accessibility, and
      modularity. Every challenge — whether design-related or algorithmic — is
      an opportunity to think deeper and grow as a developer.
