    tech: "HTML/CSS",
    percentageLearnt: 70,
    why: "These were my foundation — I’ve built full pages with semantic tags, responsive layouts, and used HTML fragments for modular, reusable components without relying on frameworks.",
  },
  {
    tech: "JavaScript",
    percentageLearnt: 60,
    why: "My main language for problem-solving and app logic. I’ve used it for dynamic UIs, worked through algorithms like graph traversal and recursion, and even optimized code by caching computations.",
  },
  {
    tech: "React",
    percentageLearnt: 60,
    why: "I’ve built real apps using hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useCallback`, `forwardRef`, etc.), implemented modals with portals, and integrated complex logic like Spotify’s Web Playback SDK.",
  },
  {
    tech: "Material UI",
    percentageLearnt: 70,
    why: "Used it to build a full dashboard with styled components and JSX-based customization. I worked with the gridData component and passed objects into rows/columns. I prefer MUI over Tailwind for React apps.",
  },
  {
    tech: "Tailwind",
    percentageLearnt: 60,
    why: "My earlier styling choice for React projects. I liked its utility-first approach and used it to quickly prototype clean UIs and dashboards before leaning more toward MUI.",
  },
  {
    tech: "Redux",
    percentageLearnt: 50,
    why: "I grasped Redux quickly due to my DSA background. I’ve used it for managing global state in my React dashboard and learned to split reducers and handle action flows properly.",
  },
  {
    tech: "React Router",
    percentageLearnt: 40,
    why: "Used to implement routing in React apps, including dashboards. I understand its limitations (like needing one router) and know how to organize nested routes and protect paths effectively.",
  },
  {
    tech: "Python",
    percentageLearnt: 40,
    why: "I’ve used Python to solve DSA problems and worked through the Standford Code In Place (CIP) course. It’s my secondary language, useful for scripting and understanding backend logic.",
  },
  {
    tech: "Flask/SQLAlchemy",
    percentageLearnt: 60,
    why: "I built the backend for my portfolio using Flask and SQLAlchemy. I understand routing, ORM, and modularizing with Flask Blueprints. I've structured APIs and handled data storage efficiently.",
  },
  {
    tech: "gitHub",
    percentageLearnt: 60,
    why: "I use GitHub daily for version control. I’ve pushed projects, resolved basic conflicts, and structured commits meaningfully. Still working on mastering advanced branching strategies.",
