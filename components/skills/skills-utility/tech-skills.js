    tech: "HTML/CSS",
    percentageLearnt: 75,
    why: "My foundation — I’ve built full semantic layouts, handled responsiveness, and used HTML fragments for modular components. Solid understanding of fundamentals.",
  },
  {
    tech: "JavaScript",
    percentageLearnt: 70,
    why: "My main problem-solving language. I’ve implemented algorithms (graphs, recursion, DP), optimized with caching, and built dynamic UI logic.",
  },
  {
    tech: "TypeScript",
    percentageLearnt: 40,
    why: "Recently picking it up to strengthen typing in React apps. I’ve worked with props typing, styled component props, and seen how it helps prevent runtime bugs.",
  },
  {
    tech: "React",
    percentageLearnt: 65,
    why: "I’ve built real apps with hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useCallback`, `forwardRef`, `useImperativeHandle`). Used portals for modals, integrated Spotify Web Playback SDK, and built dashboards.",
  },
  {
    tech: "Material UI (MUI)",
    percentageLearnt: 70,
    why: "Built a complete dashboard with custom styling, grids, and interactive tables. I lean toward MUI for React projects due to its polished component ecosystem.",
  },
  {
    tech: "Tailwind CSS",
    percentageLearnt: 60,
    why: "Utility-first styling for quick prototypes and dashboards. I used it heavily before leaning more into MUI, but I still reach for it when I want rapid design iteration.",
  },
  {
    tech: "Redux",
    percentageLearnt: 55,
    why: "I grasped state management patterns quickly because of my DSA background. I’ve handled global state in dashboards, split reducers, and managed async flows.",
  },
  {
    tech: "React Router",
    percentageLearnt: 50,
    why: "Implemented routing and nested routes for dashboards. Aware of limitations (only one router) and applied route protection techniques.",
  },
  {
    tech: "Python",
    percentageLearnt: 45,
    why: "Secondary language. Used for problem-solving, Stanford’s CIP course, and backend scripting. Clearer understanding of how Python underpins my Flask projects.",
  },
  {
    tech: "Flask/SQLAlchemy",
    percentageLearnt: 65,
    why: "Backend for my portfolio and chat app. Built REST APIs, modularized with Blueprints, set up relationships between tables, queried efficiently, and understood ORM patterns.",
  },
  {
    tech: "MySQL/PostgreSQL",
    percentageLearnt: 55,
    why: "Used MySQL Workbench locally during development and PostgreSQL on Render for hosting. This taught me about environment-specific DB configs and portability of SQLAlchemy models.",
  },
  {
    tech: "Git/GitHub",
    percentageLearnt: 65,
    why: "Daily version control use. I’ve pushed code, managed branches, fixed conflicts, and written structured commits. Still growing in advanced workflows and collaborative branching.",
